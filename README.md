# Delivery_food_app

A project made on the basis of training videos.  
In this project I learned more about interface layout, about routing between pages.  
This application uses GetX as state management, dependency injection, and route management.  
I also learned about using Google maps (but I ran out of free period of google API, and not all features will be shown on screenshots).  
The quality of the code leaves much to be desired, but I realized what mistakes I made while designing and writing the code.
